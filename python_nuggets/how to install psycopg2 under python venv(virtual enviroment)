pip install psycopg2 - will not work
first - activate your venv by this command if you're on the Ubuntu server, like I am:
. bin/actiavate
install libpq-dev and python-dev:
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python-dev python3-dev

#there is no problem if you're using pipenv over pip. 
#With pipenv u can install it without any headaches
